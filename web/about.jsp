                         The objective to design the portal is to facilitate â€œE-learning System to the students for the learning purpose from a remote location". The Portal is a Secure, Robust Web Application for E-Learning.<br><br>
                         NOU-E-Gyan Portal is a Learning Management System (LMS) for the colleges/ institutions / study centers for their unstoppable teaching to their students in the current crisis situation & in future as well since we all are now experiencing a paradigm shift. The portal is user friendly & easy to access.<br><br>
                         The portal is accessible from any hook and corner of the world if the system allows the permission of its users. It is fully secured and accessible 24 x 7 to its authorised users. It will resolve the academic issues such as E-content Distribution, Delivery, Tracking, Assessment, Progress Monitoring & Controlling of all stakeholders of the portal i.e. students, teachers, study centre administrators as well as Nalanda Open University Admins when they are at a distance.
